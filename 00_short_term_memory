# Current Task: Add comprehensive logging system with color coding

## Implemented Logging System:
1. Created logging utility module with color coding:
   - App/System (Yellow)
   - Network (Blue)
   - User (Green)
   - Bot (Magenta)

2. Added comprehensive logging to all components:
   - chat.py: RAG operations and chat interactions
   - audio.py: Speech processing operations
   - pdf_processor.py: Document handling
   - database.py: Vector store operations
   - ui.py: Interface interactions
   - main.py: Application workflow
   - app.py: Application lifecycle

3. Logging Coverage:
   - Application startup and shutdown: Track app lifecycle
   - Component initialization: Monitor setup process
   - User interactions: Track user activity
   - Network operations: Monitor external calls
   - File processing: Track document handling
   - Database operations: Monitor vector store
   - Error handling: Catch and log issues
   - State changes: Track app state transitions

## Status: Completed
All components now have comprehensive logging with color-coded output for different operation types. This will enhance debugging, monitoring, and system understanding.
